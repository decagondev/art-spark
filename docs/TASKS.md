# ArtSpark Tasks

This document outlines the development tasks for the ArtSpark project, structured hierarchically into **Epics**, **Pull Requests (PRs)**, and **Commits**. This breakdown ensures the project is manageable, allowing a developer or an LLM to tackle work in granular, atomic steps. Each commit represents a small, testable change that can be verified independently.

The structure is based on the comprehensive PRD, incorporating user personas, features, system components, implementation plan, technical specifications, and code snippets. Epics align with the phased implementation (e.g., Project Setup, AI Integration, Feature Development, Testing and Deployment). PRs group related tasks into mergeable units, and commits provide step-by-step actions.

Assumptions:
- Development uses Git for version control.
- Each PR branches from `main` (or a feature branch) and includes tests where applicable.
- Tools: Java 17, Spring Boot, MongoDB 5.0, Deeplearning4j for AI, RESTful APIs.
- Best practices: Follow clean code, include unit/integration tests, handle errors, and document code.

## Epic 1: Project Setup and Infrastructure
This epic covers initial setup, including environment configuration, database integration, and basic security.

  5. Write unit tests for the controller and form submission.

### PR 2.2: Integrate AI Model for Project Idea Generation
- **Description**: Load and integrate the AI model using Deeplearning4j, process inputs, and generate ideas.
- **Commits**:

  2. Create a service class (e.g., AiService) to load the model from 'artstylemodel.zip'.
  3. Implement method to convert UserPreferencesDTO to INDArray input.
  4. Add logic to generate output and parse into ProjectIdea objects (using provided code snippet).
  5. Handle errors (e.g., model loading failures) and add logging.
  6. Write unit tests for AI input/output processing (mock model if needed).

### PR 2.3: Develop RESTful API Endpoints for Input and Generation
- **Description**: Expose APIs for submitting input and retrieving generated ideas.
- **Commits**:
  1. Update UserInputController to handle POST /generate-ideas, calling AiService.
  2. Define response DTO for ProjectIdea (e.g., style, description, inspiration).
  3. Add API documentation using Springdoc/OpenAPI.
  4. Implement rate limiting or basic security on API endpoints.
  5. Add integration tests for end-to-end API flow (input to generation).

## Epic 3: Feature Development
This epic includes displaying ideas, user profile management, and market analysis.

### PR 3.1: Develop Project Idea Display Feature
- **Description**: Create views to display generated project ideas with details, inspiration, and trends.
- **Commits**:
  1. Create a controller for display (e.g., ProjectDisplayController with GET /ideas/{id}).
  2. Implement Thymeleaf template for idea list/detail view (include style, description, trending info).
  3. Fetch ideas from MongoDB and populate view model.
  4. Add styling/CSS for user-friendly display (e.g., cards for ideas).
  5. Write front-end tests (if using JS) or server-side rendering tests.

### PR 3.2: Implement User Profile Management
- **Description**: Allow users to save favorites, store preferences, and manage profiles.
- **Commits**:
  1. Extend UserProfile entity with fields for favorites (List<ProjectIdea>) and preferences.
  2. Create ProfileController with endpoints for /profile (GET/POST save favorite).
  3. Implement service methods for updating profiles in MongoDB.
  4. Add authentication to profile endpoints (e.g., link to user sessions).
  5. Write tests for profile CRUD and favorite saving.

### PR 3.3: Implement Market Analysis Feature
- **Description**: Add analysis for trends, competition, and integrate into idea generation.
- **Commits**:
  1. Create a MarketAnalysisService to fetch/simulate trend data (e.g., hardcoded or external API stub).
  2. Update AiService to incorporate market data into idea generation (e.g., weight outputs by trends).
  3. Add endpoint /market-analysis for querying specific styles.
  4. Implement display for analysis results (e.g., charts or tables in views).
  5. Add tests for analysis logic and integration with AI.

## Epic 4: Testing, Deployment, and Finalization
This epic ensures quality through testing and prepares for production.

### PR 4.1: Comprehensive Testing
- **Description**: Add unit, integration, and end-to-end tests across the application.

  2. Write unit tests for services (AiService, MarketAnalysisService).
  3. Add integration tests for controllers and MongoDB interactions.

  1. Generate Swagger/OpenAPI docs for all endpoints.
  2. Update README with setup, run, and usage instructions.
  3. Add inline code comments and Javadoc where needed.
  4. Fix any linting/code style issues (e.g., using Checkstyle).
  5. Conduct code review simulation and merge preparations.

## Additional Guidelines
- **Dependencies Across PRs**: PRs in later epics depend on earlier ones (e.g., AI integration before display). Use feature branches like `feature/epic1-pr1.1`.
- **Review Process**: Each PR should include a description linking to PRD sections, test evidence, and migration steps if needed.
- **Time Estimates**: Align with PRD timeline (e.g., Epic 1: 2 days, Epic 2: 4 days).
- **Risks**: Monitor AI model integration for performance; fallback to mock data if issues arise.
- **Success Criteria**: All features match user stories; app deploys successfully with no critical bugs.
